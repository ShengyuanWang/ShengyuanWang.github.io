Hey, I'm Shengyuan Wang (a.k.a. Alan, _@SWang_), a slant-rod immobile young man who knows a little bit about computer science and art. Now I am a software engineer contracted by FIRAROBO@US. Currently physically active mainly in New York and my second home in Minnesota, also want to be a digital nomad.
